## Issues: 
- if you have a windows 10 pro 64 bit (eg Lenovo X1C) machine and get an error like: 
  vt-x/amd-v hardware acceleration is not available on your system, [look here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v#enable-the-hyper-v-role-through-settings)
- if you are unable to install VirtualBox due to virtualization technology (VT-x) not being enabled on your system, [look here](https://docs-old.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/13/html/Virtualization_Guide/sect-Virtualization-Troubleshooting-Enabling_Intel_VT_and_AMD_V_virtualization_hardware_extensions_in_BIOS.html)
